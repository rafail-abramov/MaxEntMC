\section{Mathematical formulation of the maximum entropy problem
with moment constraints}

The content of this section is based on my paper titled {\em ``The
  multidimensional maximum entropy moment problem: A review on
  numerical methods''}, published in Commun. Math. Sci. Some parts of
the section content below may be copied, with minor changes, from that
work. For more details, please refer to that work and references
therein.

\subsection{Notations}

Let $N$ be a positive integer number. Let $\mathbb R^N$ be an
$N$-dimensional space of real numbers, and let $\mathbb Z^N$ be an
$N$-dimensional space of nonnegative integer numbers. Let $\BS x$
denote an element of $\mathbb R^N$, and let $\BS i$ denote an element
of $\mathbb Z^N$. We define a {\em monomial} $\BS x^{\BS i}$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monomial}
\BS x^{\BS i}=x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\ldots x_N^{i_N}=\prod_{k=1}^N x_k^{i_k}.
\end{equation}
%
We denote the {\em power} $|\BS i|$ of the monomial in
\eqref{eq:monomial} as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monomial_power}
|\BS i|=i_1+i_2+\ldots+i_N=\sum_{k=1}^N i_k.
\end{equation}
%
Let $U$ be a domain in $\mathbb R^N$. Let $\rho:U\to\mathbb R$ denote
any nonnegative continuous function on $U$, with the condition that
%
\begin{equation}
\int_U\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x<\infty.
\end{equation}
%
In this case, $\rho$ is called the {\em density}. Given an element
$\BS i\in\mathbb Z^N$, we denote the corresponding {\em moment}
$m_{\BS i}[\rho]$ as
%
\begin{equation}
m_{\BS i}[\rho]=\int_U\BS x^{\BS i}\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x.
\end{equation}
%
Let $P$ be a finite subset of $\mathbb Z^N$. Let $\rho_{\BS
  c}:U\to\mathbb R$ denote any $\rho$ for which all $m_{\BS i}$, such
that $\BS i\in P$, are finite, and are given by a set of real numbers
$c_{\BS i}\in\mathbb R$, for all $\BS i\in P$:
%
\begin{equation}
m_{\BS i}[\rho_{\BS c}]=c_{\BS i},\qquad\forall \BS i\in P.
\end{equation}
%
It is then said that $\rho_{\BS c}$ possesses a set of moments (or
{\em moment constraints}, in the context of what is presented below)
$\BS c$. There are two things which need to be emphasized:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item For an arbitrarily specified set of real numbers $\BS c$, the
  corresponding density $\rho_{\BS c}$ does not have to exist (for
  example, suppose that $\BS i$ includes only even integers, yet
  $c_{\BS i}<0$);
\item When $\rho_{\BS c}$ nonetheless exists, it does not have to be
  unique.
\end{enumerate}
%
What is presented below deals with the second situation.

\subsection{Maximum entropy under moment constraints}

We define the {\em Shannon entropy} $S[\rho]$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:entropy}
S[\rho]=-\int_U\rho(\BS x)\ln\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x.
\end{equation}
%
Shannon entropy is recognized as a measure of uncertainty in
probability densities. In the context of the maximum entropy problem,
the goal is to find $\rho_{\BS c}^*$ among all $\rho_{\BS c}$, such
that is maximizes $S$:
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\BS c}^*=\arg\max_{\rho_{\BS c}}S[\rho_{\BS c}].
\end{equation}
%
It can be shown via variational analysis that $\rho_{\BS c}^*$ belongs
to the family of functions $f_{\BS\lambda}:U\to\mathbb R$, where
$\BS\lambda=\{\lambda_{\BS i}\}$ are real numbers (called the {\em
  Lagrange multipliers}), $\BS i\in P$. $f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)$ is
explicitly given by
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)=\exp\left(\sum_{\BS i\in P}\lambda_{\BS i}\BS
x^{\BS i}\right).
\end{equation}
%
Depending on the sets $U$, $P$ and on the values $\BS\lambda$,
$f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)$ may or may not be a density; indeed, observe
that while any $f_{\BS\lambda}$ is certainly nonnegative, its integral
over $U$ does not have to be finite. More precisely, any
$f_{\BS\lambda}$ is a density over a finite domain $U$, but not all
$f_{\BS\lambda}$ are densities when $U$ is not a finite domain.

Our goal now is to find the set $\BS\lambda^*$ for which
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\BS\lambda^*}(\BS x)=\rho_{\BS c}^*(\BS x), \qquad\forall\BS x\in
U.
\end{equation}
%
This is accomplished by computing the minimum of the {\em Lagrangian
  function} (or shortly, the Lagrangian)
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrangian}
L(\BS\lambda)=\int_U f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)\dif x-\sum_{\BS i\in
  P}c_{\BS i}\lambda_{\BS i}.
\end{equation}
%
The gradient (the vector of the first derivatives) and hessian (the
matrix of the second derivatives) of the Lagrangian are given,
respectively, via
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\parderiv L{\lambda_{\BS i}}=m_{\BS i}[f_{\BS\lambda}]-c_{\BS i},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\parderiv{^2 L}{\lambda_{\BS i}\partial\lambda_{\BS j}}=m_{\BS i+\BS
  j}[f_{\BS\lambda}].
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
From the above expressions, it is easy to see that the gradient of $L$
is zero when the moment constraints are met (that is, a critial point
of $L$ is found), and that the hessian of $L$ is positive definite,
which means that the critical point is indeed a unique minimum. Note
that, in general, the critial point does not have to exist.
