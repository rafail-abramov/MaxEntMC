\section{Introduction}

MaxEntMC is a maximum entropy algorithm with moment constraints, which
can be adapted to computation of the maximum entropy problem with the
user-defined set of moment constraints, user-defined quadrature (and,
therefore, domain) on the $N$-dimensional Euclidean space (where $N$
is realistically no greater than 3 or 4 due to computational
limitations on the numerical quadrature), via user-defined iterations
of finding the critical point of the corresponding objective function
(such as the Newton or quasi-Newton methods). In a certain sense,
MaxEntMC is a set of tools to produce an individually tailored maximum
entropy algorithm for a given problem, although some simple examples
of maximum entropy quadrature and iteration implementations are
included with the code. The MaxEntMC provides the user with the
following core tools for the maximum entropy computation:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set of data structures and routines to initialize, save and
  load moment constraints and corresponding Lagrange multipliers of
  arbitrary dimension and power;
\item A set of quadrature helper routines to implement a parallel
  (currently shared-memory multithreaded) numerical quadrature for
  density moments over a set of user-specified abscissas and weights;
\item A set of routines to transform the computed density moments into
  the gradient vector and hessian matrix of the Lagrangian objective
  function.
\end{enumerate}
%
In addition, MaxEntMC provides the user with the following 
example routines for better illustration:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A simple uniform quadrature routine over a user-specified
  rectangular domain;
\item A Newton method routine with a primitive inexact line search for
  computation of the critical point of the objective Lagrangian
  function.
\end{enumerate}
%
It is, however, expected that the user will tailor the algorithm
precisely to their particular maximum entropy problem by implementing
their own quadrature and iteration methods.

The manual is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:math} presents a
mathematical formulation of the maximum entropy problem with moment
constraints. Section \ref{sec:constraints} documents the routines
necessary for operations with moment constraints and Lagrange
multipliers. Section \ref{sec:quadrature} documents the quadrature
helper routines which are needed to set up the user-specified
quadrature. Section \ref{sec:grad_hess} documents the routines which
are used to extract the gradient and hessian of the Lagrangian
function from the computed moments in a generic vector and matrix
form.

\section{Mathematical formulation of the maximum entropy problem
with moment constraints}
\label{sec:math}

The content of this section is based on my paper titled {\em ``The
  multidimensional maximum entropy moment problem: A review on
  numerical methods''}, published in Commun. Math. Sci. Some parts of
the section content below may be copied, with minor changes, from that
work. For more details, please refer to that work and references
therein.

\subsection{Notations}

Let $N$ be a positive integer number. Let $\mathbb R^N$ be an
$N$-dimensional space of real numbers, and let $\mathbb Z^N$ be an
$N$-dimensional space of nonnegative integer numbers. Let $\BS x$
denote an element of $\mathbb R^N$, and let $\BS i$ denote an element
of $\mathbb Z^N$. We define a {\em monomial} $\BS x^{\BS i}$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monomial}
\BS x^{\BS i}=x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\ldots x_N^{i_N}=\prod_{k=1}^N x_k^{i_k}.
\end{equation}
%
We denote the {\em power} $|\BS i|$ of the monomial in
\eqref{eq:monomial} as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:monomial_power}
|\BS i|=i_1+i_2+\ldots+i_N=\sum_{k=1}^N i_k.
\end{equation}
%
Let $U$ be a domain in $\mathbb R^N$. Let $\rho:U\to\mathbb R$ denote
any nonnegative continuous function on $U$, with the condition that
%
\begin{equation}
\int_U\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x<\infty.
\end{equation}
%
In this case, $\rho$ is called the {\em density}. Given an element
$\BS i\in\mathbb Z^N$, we denote the corresponding {\em moment}
$m_{\BS i}[\rho]$ as
%
\begin{equation}
m_{\BS i}[\rho]=\int_U\BS x^{\BS i}\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x.
\end{equation}
%
Let $P$ be a finite subset of $\mathbb Z^N$. Let $\rho_{\BS
  c}:U\to\mathbb R$ denote any $\rho$ for which all $m_{\BS i}$, such
that $\BS i\in P$, are finite, and are given by a set of real numbers
$c_{\BS i}\in\mathbb R$, for all $\BS i\in P$:
%
\begin{equation}
m_{\BS i}[\rho_{\BS c}]=c_{\BS i},\qquad\forall \BS i\in P.
\end{equation}
%
It is then said that $\rho_{\BS c}$ possesses a set of moments (or
{\em moment constraints}, in the context of what is presented below)
$\BS c$. There are two things which need to be emphasized:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item For an arbitrarily specified set of real numbers $\BS c$, the
  corresponding density $\rho_{\BS c}$ does not have to exist (for
  example, suppose that $\BS i$ includes only even integers, yet
  $c_{\BS i}<0$);
\item When $\rho_{\BS c}$ nonetheless exists, it does not have to be
  unique.
\end{enumerate}
%
What is presented below deals with the second situation.

\subsection{Maximum entropy under moment constraints}

We define the {\em Shannon entropy} $S[\rho]$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:entropy}
S[\rho]=-\int_U\rho(\BS x)\ln\rho(\BS x)\dif\BS x.
\end{equation}
%
Shannon entropy is recognized as a measure of uncertainty in
probability densities. In the context of the maximum entropy problem,
the goal is to find $\rho_{\BS c}^*$ among all $\rho_{\BS c}$, such
that is maximizes $S$:
%
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\BS c}^*=\arg\max_{\rho_{\BS c}}S[\rho_{\BS c}].
\end{equation}
%
It can be shown via variational analysis that $\rho_{\BS c}^*$ belongs
to the family of functions $f_{\BS\lambda}:U\to\mathbb R$, where
$\BS\lambda=\{\lambda_{\BS i}\}$ are real numbers (called the {\em
  Lagrange multipliers}), $\BS i\in P$. $f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)$ is
explicitly given by
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)=\exp\left(\sum_{\BS i\in P}\lambda_{\BS i}\BS
x^{\BS i}\right).
\end{equation}
%
Depending on the sets $U$, $P$ and on the values $\BS\lambda$,
$f_{\BS\lambda}(\BS x)$ may or may not be a density; indeed, observe
that while any $f_{\BS\lambda}$ is certainly nonnegative, its integral
over $U$ does not have to be finite. More precisely, any
$f_{\BS\lambda}$ is a density over a finite domain $U$, but not all
$f_{\BS\lambda}$ are densities when $U$ is not a finite domain.

Our goal now is to find the set $\BS\lambda^*$ for which
%
\begin{equation}
f_{\BS\lambda^*}(\BS x)=\rho_{\BS c}^*(\BS x), \qquad\forall\BS x\in
U.
\end{equation}
%
This is accomplished by computing the minimum of the {\em Lagrangian
  function} (or shortly, the Lagrangian)
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrangian}
L(\BS\lambda)=m_{\BS 0}[f_{\BS\lambda}]-\sum_{\BS i\in
  P}c_{\BS i}\lambda_{\BS i}.
\end{equation}
%
The gradient (the vector of the first derivatives) and hessian (the
matrix of the second derivatives) of the Lagrangian are given,
respectively, via
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\parderiv L{\lambda_{\BS i}}=m_{\BS i}[f_{\BS\lambda}]-c_{\BS i},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\parderiv{^2 L}{\lambda_{\BS i}\partial\lambda_{\BS j}}=m_{\BS i+\BS
  j}[f_{\BS\lambda}].
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
From the above expressions, it is easy to see that the gradient of $L$
is zero when the moment constraints are met (that is, a critial point
of $L$ is found), and that the hessian of $L$ is positive definite,
which means that the critical point is indeed a unique minimum. Note
that, in general, the critial point does not have to exist.

The optimal set of Lagrange multipliers $\BS\lambda$ can be found
iteratively, using a plethora of standard methods such as the Newton
method, or a variable metric quasi-Newton method (such as the BFGS
algorithm). The Newton method requires the computation of the hessian,
while the quasi-Newton methods use a ``finite difference'' secant
approximation for the hessian from the set of gradients computed at
different points along the optimization path. Either iteration method
can be implemented with MaxEntMC.

\section{How to use MaxEntMC}

Computation of the set of Lagrange multipliers $\BS\lambda$ from the
set of constraints $\BS c$ can be split into the following tasks:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Definition of constraints and Lagrange multipliers;
\item Computation of moments from the Lagrange multipliers using the
  numerical quadrature;
\item Conversion of computed moments into the value of the Lagrangian
  objective function, its gradient vector and hessian matrix;
\item (Quasi-) Newton iterations over the set of Lagrange multipliers
  until suitable tolerance is achieved.
\end{enumerate}
%
By the design of MaxEntMC, the last step is left to the user. Below we
explain how to do other steps. All relevant data structures and
routines, described below, are declared in
\texttt{src/user/maxentmc.h}.

\subsection{Basic types defined by MaxEntMC}

The two basic types defined by MaxEntMC are
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{maxentmc\_index\_t} -- this is the integer type to hold
  the dimension of the problem and values of powers. It is currently
  defined as \texttt{uint8\_t}, since it is highly unlikely that the
  dimension or power of the maximum entropy problem can realistically
  exceed 255.
\item \texttt{maxentmc\_float\_t} -- this is the floating point type
  used to hold real numbers in the algorithm. It is currently defined
  as \texttt{double}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to specify constraints and Lagrange multipliers}
\label{sec:constraints}

The basic data type to hold a vector of real values with attached
powers is given by
%
\begin{minted}[mathescape,
               %linenos,
               numbersep=5pt,
               %gobble=2,
               frame=lines,
               framesep=2mm]{c}
struct maxentmc_power_vector_struct {
    gsl_vector gsl_vec;    /* This is the standard GSL vector */
    struct maxentmc_power_struct * powers;   /* This is the pointer to the
        opaque structure which holds powers for each element of gsl_vec */
};
typedef struct maxentmc_power_vector_struct * maxentmc_power_vector_t;
  /* For convenience, the pointer to the structure is defined as a type */
\end{minted}
%
Here, the values are contained \texttt{gsl\_vec}, which is a standard
GSL vector structure (with all GSL routines applicable to it, except
for allocation/freeing), and are directly accessible by dereferencing
\texttt{gsl\_vec.data} pointer, which is of type
\texttt{maxentmc\_float\_t}. On the other hand, \texttt{powers} is the
pointer to the opaque structure which contains powers attached to each
value contained in \texttt{gsl\_vec}.

\subsubsection{Operations with an existing power vector}

When an object of type \texttt{maxentmc\_power\_vector\_t} is already
allocated and initialized (more on this later), the following basic
operations are provided for it:

\subsubsection{Initialization of a power vector}

A power vector can be allocated and initialized (filled with data) in
the following ways:
%
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item From an existing power vector. In this case, the new power
  vector inherits the powers from the existing power vector. The
  vector elements can then be initialized either by directly accessing
  the elements of \texttt{gsl\_vec.data}, by reading previously saved
  data from a stream, or by arithmetic operations with vectors
  provided by GSL.
\item As a product of two existing power vectors (this is needed for
  the hessian computation). In this case, the new power vector obtains
  its powers from the product of powers of the two existing power
  vectors. The subsequent initialization of vector elements is same as
  above.
\item By reading the previously saved power structure from a stream.
  The subsequent initialization of vector elements is same as above.
\item From an object of the type \texttt{maxentmc\_list\_t}. This is
  the most general, safe (and slow) way of initializing a power
  vector.
\end{enumerate}

Below is the list of allocation and initialization functions.
